# Bipedal Humanoid Robot for Assisting Visually Impaired People

Welcome to the repository of our innovative project that focuses on creating a bipedal humanoid robot to assist visually impaired people in their day-to-day activities. This project aims to create the software code that enables the robot to assist in activities such as:

- Navigation through different environments and places
- Monitoring health conditions and reporting them to healthcare providers

**Please Note: The project is currently under development. We are presently focused on creating the code responsible for the robot's locomotion.**
